     * to impose an ordering that differs from the ordering of the ids.
     * The type encodes the variable type.
     *
     * Usually, variables should be created using the carl::VariablePool.
     * The VariablePool makes sure that a new variable gets a fresh consecutive
     * ID and stores variable names.
