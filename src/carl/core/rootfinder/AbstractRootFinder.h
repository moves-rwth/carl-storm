/**
 * Base class for a root finding algorithm for a single univariate polynomial.
 *
 * This class provides some generic routines and an interface for finding the real roots of a univariate polynomial.
 * Whenever a root is found exactly, the polynomial is reduced, that is the linear factor (x - root) is removed from the polynomial.
 *
 * The basic usage works like this:
 * <ul>
 *	<li>Create RootFinder with a polynomial and an optional interval</li>
 *	<li>The RootFinder immediately performs some basic checks:
 *		<ul>
 *			<li>If 0 is a root, it is added to the set of roots and the polynomial is reduced accordingly</li>
 *			<li>If the degree of the polynomial is at most two, the roots are obtained using a closed formula.</li>
 *		</ul>
 *	</li>
 *	<li>Call getAllRoots() to obtain all real roots.</li>
 * </ul>
